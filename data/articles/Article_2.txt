Poe was connected at various times and in various capacities with the
Southern Literary Messenger in Richmond. Graham’s Magazine and
the Gentleman’s Magazine in Philadelphia, the “Evening Mirror,” the
“Broadway Journal,” and “Godey’s Lady’s Book” in New York. Everywhere
Poe’s life was one of unremitting toil. No tales and poems were ever
produced at a greater cost of brain and spirit.

Poe’s initial salary with the “Southern Literary Messenger,” to which
he contributed the first drafts of a number of his best-known tales,
was $10 a week! Two years later his salary was but $600 a year. Even in
1844, when his literary reputation was established securely, he wrote to
a friend expressing his pleasure because a magazine to which he was to
contribute had agreed to pay him $20 monthly for two pages of criticism.

Those were discouraging times in American literature, but Poe never
lost faith. He was finally to triumph wherever pre-eminent talents win
admirers. His genius has had no better description than in this stanza
from William Winter’s poem, read at the dedication exercises of the
Actors’ Monument to Poe, May 4, 1885, in New York.
